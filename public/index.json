Recognizing the patterns of somatic mutations in cancer is essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive the disease (Fischer et al., 2013). This knowledge is crucial for advancing cancer treatment and prevention.\nOne type of somatic mutation is the single nucleotide variant (SNV), also referred to as a single base substitution. This involves the replacement of one base pair in the genome with another. There are six possible base pair mutations: C:G\u0026gt;A:T, C:G\u0026gt;G:C, C:G\u0026gt;T:A, T:A\u0026gt;A:T, T:A\u0026gt;C:G, and T:A\u0026gt;G:C. When considering the context of the immediate 5’ and 3’ neighboring bases, the total number of mutations increases to 96, calculated as $6 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 96$. These are known as trinucleotide mutation channels. Examples of such mutations include ACA:TGT\u0026gt;AAA:TTT and ACT:TGA\u0026gt;AGT:TCA. For simplicity, we will abbreviate these mutations as ACA\u0026gt;AAA and ACT\u0026gt;AGT respectively.\nMutational Signature A mutational signature $\\theta$ with respect to trinucleotide mutation channels is a discrete probability distribution over the 96 mutational channels i.e. $\\theta\\in \\Delta^{96}$ where\n$$ \\Delta^{n} = \\left\\{ (x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{n}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\mid x_i \\geq 0 \\text{ for all } i \\text{ and } \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = 1 \\right\\}. $$ A mutational signature $\\theta$ can be visualised as in the following.\nThe framework for studying somatic mutations through mutational signatures was introduced in a landmark study by Alexandrov et al. (2013), where over 7,000 bulk-sequenced cancer samples were analyzed. Conceptually, a mutational signature represents a biological process acting on the genome, leaving a distinct imprint captured in a probability vector, $\\theta$. Well-established examples include the mutational signatures associated with tobacco exposure and UV light. A comprehensive list of mutational signatures and their proposed underlying biological processes is available through the COSMIC project. However, experimentally verifying a mutational signature, or its corresponding probability vector $\\theta$, remains a significant challenge.\nA particular sample is acted upon by different mutational signatures. The sample-specific mutational signature activity of each mutational signatures has been used clinically to stratify patient cohorts.\nTo estimate mutational signatures and their activities, Alexandrov et al. (2013) employed Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). NMF and its variations remain the most widely used methods for estimating mutational signatures and mutational signature activities.\u0026#34;\nExtracts from different papers on overall legitimacy of mutational signatures and proposed underlying biological process “Furthermore, while earlier analyses reported single signatures, for example of UV radiation (that is, SBS7)2, more recent studies reported multiple versions of these signatures (that is, SBS7a, SBS7b, SBS7c and SBS7d)3, leading the community to question whether some find­ ings are reflective of biology or are simply mathemat­ ical artefacts. Efforts to experimentally validate these abstract mathematical results are therefore warranted.\u0026#34; “Regardless of the algorithms used for signature identification, common signatures tend to be consistently identifiable in most cohorts examined,\u0026#34; Whether these new signatures “true biologically or are merely a mathematical outcome is less clear and awaits independent verification.\u0026#34; “This lack of robustness is often due to the non-uniqueness of the NMF decomposition, which — for any given matrix — has a potentially infinite set of valid solutions” “observed mutation counts and the ones predicted from the given set of signatures” “still no objective way to determine whether the inferred signatures actually correspond to any known mutational” “often confirmed through experimental data (Segovia et al., 2015; Drost et al., 2017).\u0026#34; Recommended Material on legitamcy of mutational signatures: Koh, G., Degasperi, A., Zou, X., Momen, S., \u0026amp; Nik-Zainal, S.

The covariates may contain information on prior probabilities of null and alternative hypotheses and/or on the test’s power. As per several recent proposals, the independent hypothesis weighting (IHW, Ignatiadis and Huber, 2021) framework capitalizes on these covariates for the multiple testing procedure. IHW partitions the covariate space into a finite number of bins and learns weights, used to prioritize each bin a-priori based on the covariate. IHW guarantees false discovery rate control (FDR), while increasing the proportion of correct discoveries (power) compared to unweighted methods such as the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (BH).\n(Ignatiadis and Huber, 2021) use per-covariate quantiles for the partition. Limitations of this are, that the number of quantile combinations explode with multiple covariates and the bins have fixed side length. Here we propose a random forest-based approach (IHW-Forest), where the leaves of the trees form a partition for the covariates. The objective function is chosen such that the splits are sensitive to the prior probability of a hypothesis being true. IHW-Forest scales well to high-dimensional covariates and can detect small regions with signal. IHW-Forest can deal with heterogeneous covariates and ignore uninformative covariates. Latter is useful in practice, when the user does not know which covariates are relevant for the hypotheses under study. This extends the application of IHW by automatic selection of the most relevant covariate. Lastly, IHW-Forest takes advantage of the p-values to construct the partition, yielding homogeneous bins and hence increases power.\nWe demonstrate IHW-forest’s benefits in simulations and in a bioinformatic application. IHWs power vanishes with increasing number of covariate dimensions, while IHW-Forest's power remains stable and well above BH and IHW. With the signal concentrated in a shrinking region, IHW-Forest outperforms BH, IHW and other competing methods in power. We apply IHW-Forest to a hQTL analysis, which looks for associations between genetic variation and histone modifications on the human chromosomes. This resulted in 16 billion tests on the first two chromosomes. We used 16 different covariates, among them the genomic distance and his-tone modifications. Due to an exponential increase of the number of per-covariate quantiles with the number of covariates, IHW is not applicable anymore.
