              * Researching statistical methods for mutational patterns estimation with tree structures in the lab of [Niko Beerenwinkel](https://bsse.ethz.ch/cbg/group.html) with focus on data from the [Tumor Profiler](https://eth-nexus.github.io/tu-pro_website/).
              * Lecture on Statistical Models in Computational Biology covering hidden Markov models, EM algorithm, Variational inference.
              * I developed a novel Bayesian model using Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (HDP) to analyze mutational signatures by integrating data from evolutionary trees. The model is designed to leverage the phylogenetic relationships between cancer subclones, assuming that evolutionarily closer cells exhibit more similar mutational signature activities. This non-parametric approach learns the number of signatures directly from the data while using the tree structure as a prior to guide the estimation of signature activities. A prototype was implemented and applied to single-cell sequencing data, allowing for the simultaneous discovery of signatures and the mapping of their activities across the cellular phylogeny. My blog post can be found [here](https://danielfridljand.de/post/mutational-signature-with-hierarchical-dirichlet-process/).

              * Developed IHW-Forest, a scalable solution to the "curse of dimensionality" that previously limited the standard [IHW method](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/IHW.html) for high-dimensional datasets.
              * Supervised by [Wolfgang Huber](https://www.huber.embl.de/) and [Nikos Ignatiadis](https://nignatiadis.github.io/).
              * Designed an innovative stratification algorithm that automatically selects and ranks informative covariates, enhancing robustness to noisy and unknown features in real-world data.
              * Led the project from inception to dissemination, presenting results at seven scientific events, including invited talks at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/), [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/), and a competitively selected oral presentation at [DAGStat 2022](https://www.dagstat2022.uni-hamburg.de/bilder/booklet.pdf) before 100 scholars.
              * Applied IHW-Forest in a large-scale production analysis of 16 billion genetic tests, utilizing 11 covariates to boost the discovery of significant SNP-histone associations by over 30% compared to alternative methods.
              * Incorporated concepts from selective inference, machine learning, and empirical Bayes.
              * Served as a peer reviewer for Bioinformatics Advances and Cell Biology.
