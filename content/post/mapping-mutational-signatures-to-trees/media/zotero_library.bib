  abstract = {Many data are naturally modeled by an unobserved hierarchical structure. In this paper we propose a flexible nonparametric prior over unknown data hierarchies. The approach uses nested stick-breaking processes to allow for trees of unbounded width and depth, where data can live at any node and are infinitely exchangeable. One can view our model as providing infinite mixtures where the components have a dependency structure corresponding to an evolutionary diffusion down a tree. By using a stick-breaking approach, we can apply Markov chain Monte Carlo methods based on slice sampling to perform Bayesian inference and simulate from the posterior distribution on trees. We apply our method to hierarchical clustering of images and topic modeling of text data.},

Analysis of latent topics within such content is crucial for tasks like trend and user interest analysis. Nonparametric topic models are a powerful approach, but traditional Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (HDPs) are unable to fully take into account topic sharing across deep hierarchical structure. We propose the Tree-structured Hierarchical Dirichlet Process, allowing Dirichlet process based topic modeling over a given tree structure of arbitrary size and height, where documents can arise at all tree nodes. Experiments on a hierarchical social message forum and a product reviews forum demonstrate better generalization performance than traditional HDPs in terms of ability to model new data and classify documents to sections.},

  abstract = {The genome of a cancer cell carries somatic mutations that are the cumulative consequences of the DNA damage and repair processes operative during the cellular lineage between the fertilized egg and the cancer cell. Remarkably, these mutational processes are poorly characterized. Global sequencing initiatives are yielding catalogs of somatic mutations from thousands of cancers, thus providing the unique opportunity to decipher the signatures of mutational processes operative in human cancer. However, until now there have been no theoretical models describing the signatures of mutational processes operative in cancer genomes and no systematic computational approaches are available to decipher these mutational signatures. Here, by modeling mutational processes as a blind source separation problem, we introduce a computational framework that effectively addresses these questions. Our approach provides a basis for characterizing mutational signatures from cancer-derived somatic mutational catalogs, paving the way to insights into the pathogenetic mechanism underlying all cancers., Stratton and colleagues provide a theoretical model and computational framework that bridge the gap between mutational catalogs derived from cancer genomes and the signatures of mutational processes contained in these catalogs. They extensively evaluate their framework with simulated and real data, demonstrating that it allows incorporation of a wide variety of different mutation types. The framework is robust to a large range of different parameters and applicable to mutational catalogs derived from genome and exome sequencing.},

We present a clustering approach that incorporates causal fairness metrics to provide a more nuanced approach to fairness in unsupervised learning. Our approach enables the specification of the causal fairness metrics that should be minimised. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology using datasets known to harbour unfair biases.},

While inference of the marginal probability distribution is crucial for various problems in machine learning and statistics, its exact computation is generally not feasible for categorical variables in Bayesian networks due to the NP-hardness of this task. We develop a divide-and-conquer approach using the graphical properties of Bayesian networks to split the computation of the marginal probability distribution into sub-calculations of lower dimensionality, thus reducing the overall computational complexity. Exploiting this property, we present an efficient and scalable algorithm for calculating the marginal probability distribution for categorical variables. The novel method is compared against state-of-the-art approximate inference methods in a benchmarking study, where it displays superior performance. As an immediate application, we demonstrate how our method can be used to classify incomplete data against Bayesian networks and use this approach for identifying the cancer subtype of kidney cancer patient samples.},

  abstract = {Myeloid malignancies exhibit considerable heterogeneity with overlapping clinical and genetic features among different subtypes. Current classification schemes, predominantly based on clinical features, fall short of capturing the complex genomic landscapes of these malignancies. Here, we present a data-driven approach that integrates mutational features and clinical covariates within networks of their probabilistic relationships, enabling the discovery of de novo cancer subgroups. In a cohort of 1323 patients across acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and myeloproliferative neoplasms, we identified novel subgroups that outperform established risk classifications in prognostic accuracy. Our findings suggest that mutational patterns are often shared across different types of myeloid malignancies, with distinct subtypes potentially representing evolutionary stages en route to leukemia. Within the novel subgroups, our integrative method discerns unique patterns combining genomic and clinical features to provide a comprehensive view of the multifaceted genomic and clinical landscape of myeloid malignancies. This in turn may guide the development of targeted therapeutic strategies and offers a pathway to enhanced patient stratification.},

Although multiple methods for the computational analysis of scRNA-seq data exist, their application in a clinical setting demands standardized and reproducible workflows, targeted to extract, condense, and display the clinically relevant information. To this end, we designed scAmpi (Single Cell Analysis mRNA pipeline), a workflow that facilitates scRNA-seq analysis from raw read processing to informing on sample composition, clinically relevant gene and pathway alterations, and in silico identification of personalized candidate drug treatments. We demonstrate the value of this workflow for clinical decision making in a molecular tumor board as part of a clinical study.},

The rate of somatic evolution within a cell population can vary due to multiple factors, including selection, a change in the mutation rate, or differences in the microenvironment. Here, we developed a statistical test called the Poisson Tree (PT) test to detect varying evolutionary rates among cell lineages, leveraging the phylogenetic signal of single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) data. We applied the PT test to 24 healthy and cancer samples, rejecting a constant evolutionary rate in 11 out of 15 cancer and five out of nine healthy scDNA-seq datasets. In six cancer datasets, we identified subclonal mutations in known driver genes that could explain the rate accelerations of particular cancer lineages. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of scDNA-seq for studying somatic evolution and suggest that cell lineages often evolve at different rates within cancer and healthy tissues.},

We demonstrate the ability of NMF to recover meaningful biological information from cancer-related microarray data. NMF appears to have advantages over other methods such as hierarchical clustering or self-organizing maps. We found it less sensitive to a priori selection of genes or initial conditions and able to detect alternative or context-dependent patterns of gene expression in complex biological systems. This ability, similar to semantic polysemy in text, provides a general method for robust molecular pattern discovery.},

In comparison with existing methods on synthetic and real tumor data, BiTSC\$\textasciicircum 2\$ shows high accuracy in genotype recovery, subclonal assignment and tree reconstruction.

We then show how fine distributions can be used to study the limitations of existing mutual information estimators, investigate the behavior of neural critics used in variational estimators, and understand the effect of experimental outliers on mutual information estimation. Finally, we show how fine distributions can be used to obtain model-based Bayesian estimates of mutual information, suitable for problems with available domain expertise in which uncertainty quantification is necessary.},

  abstract = {Onco-hematological studies are increasingly adopting statistical mixture models to support the advancement of the genomically-driven classification systems for blood cancer. Targeting enhanced patients stratification based on the sole role of molecular biology attracted much interest and contributes to bring personalized medicine closer to reality. In onco-hematology, Hierarchical Dirichlet Mixture Models (HDMM) have become one of the preferred method to cluster the genomics data, that include the presence or absence of gene mutations and cytogenetics anomalies, into components. This work unfolds the standard workflow used in onco-hematology to improve patient stratification and proposes alternative approaches to characterize the components and to assign patient to them, as they are crucial tasks usually supported by a priori clinical knowledge. We propose (a) to compute the parameters of the multinomial components of the HDMM or (b) to estimate the parameters of the HDMM components as if they were Multivariate Fisher’s Non-Central Hypergeometric (MFNCH) distributions. Then, our approach to perform patients assignments to the HDMM components is designed to essentially determine for each patient its most likely component. We show on simulated data that the patients assignment using the MFNCH-based approach can be superior, if not comparable, to using the multinomial-based approach. Lastly, we illustrate on real Acute Myeloid Leukemia data how the utilization of MFNCH-based approach emerges as a good trade-off between the rigorous multinomial-based characterization of the HDMM components and the common refinement of them based on a priori clinical knowledge.},

  abstract = {Genetic perturbation screens using RNA interference (RNAi) have been conducted successfully to identify host factors that are essential for the life cycle of bacteria or viruses. So far, most published studies identified host factors primarily for single pathogens. Furthermore, often only a small subset of genes, e.g., genes encoding kinases, have been targeted. Identification of host factors on a pan-pathogen level, i.e., genes that are crucial for the replication of a diverse group of pathogens has received relatively little attention, despite the fact that such common host factors would be highly relevant, for instance, for devising broad-spectrum anti-pathogenic drugs. Here, we present a novel two-stage procedure for the identification of host factors involved in the replication of different viruses using a combination of random effects models and Markov random walks on a functional interaction network. We first infer candidate genes by jointly analyzing multiple perturbations screens while at the same time adjusting for high variance inherent in these screens. Subsequently the inferred estimates are spread across a network of functional interactions thereby allowing for the analysis of missing genes in the biological studies, smoothing the effect sizes of previously found host factors, and considering a priori pathway information defined over edges of the network. We applied the procedure to RNAi screening data of four different positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, Hepatitis C virus, Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and detected novel host factors, including UBC, PLCG1, and DYRK1B, which are predicted to significantly impact the replication cycles of these viruses. We validated the detected host factors experimentally using pharmacological inhibition and an additional siRNA screen and found that some of the predicted host factors indeed influence the replication of these pathogens.},

However, knocking out or knocking down genes is a highly error-prone process that complicates estimation of the effect sizes of the interventions. Here, we introduce a family of generative models, called the structured hierarchical model (SHM) for probabilistic inference of causal effects from perturbation screens. SHMs utilize classical hierarchical models to represent heterogeneous data and combine them with categorical Markov random fields to encode biological prior information over functionally related biological entities. The random field induces a clustering of functionally related genes which informs inference of parameters in the hierarchical model. The SHM is designed for extremely noisy data sets for which the true data generating process is difficult to model due to lack of domain knowledge or high stochasticity of the interventions. We apply the SHM to a pan-cancer genetic perturbation screen in order to identify genes that restrict the growth of an entire group of cancer cell lines and show that incorporating prior knowledge in the form of a graph improves inference of parameters.},

  abstract = {Cancers develop and progress as mutations accumulate, and with the advent of single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing, researchers can observe these mutations and their transcriptomic effects and predict proteomic changes with remarkable temporal and spatial precision. However, to connect genomic mutations with their transcriptomic and proteomic consequences, cells with either only DNA data or only RNA data must be mapped to a common domain. For this purpose, we present MaCroDNA, a method that uses maximum weighted bipartite matching of per-gene read counts from single-cell DNA and RNA-seq data. Using ground truth information from colorectal cancer data, we demonstrate the advantage of MaCroDNA over existing methods in accuracy and speed. Exemplifying the utility of single-cell data integration in cancer research, we suggest, based on results derived using MaCroDNA, that genomic mutations of large effect size increasingly contribute to differential expression between cells as Barrett’s esophagus progresses to esophageal cancer, reaffirming the findings of the previous studies.},

  abstract = {Cancer arises and evolves by the accumulation of somatic mutations that provide a selective advantage. The interplay of mutations and their functional consequences shape the evolutionary dynamics of tumors and contribute to different clinical outcomes. In the absence of scalable methods to jointly assay genomic and transcriptomic profiles of the same individual cell, the two data modalities are usually measured separately and need to be integrated computationally. Here, we introduce SCATrEx, a statistical model to map single-cell gene expression data onto the evolutionary history of copy number alterations of the tumor. SCATrEx jointly assigns cancer cells assayed with scRNA-seq to copy number profiles arranged in a copy number aberration tree and augments the tree with clone-specific clusters. Our simulations show that SCATrEx improves over both state-of-the-art unsupervised clustering methods and cell-to-clone assignment methods. In an application to real data, we observe that SCATrEx finds inter-clone and intra-clone gene expression heterogeneity not detectable using other integration methods. SCATrEx will allow for a better understanding of tumor evolution by jointly analysing the genomic and transcriptomic changes that drive it.},

Cell- and clone-specific high-level amplifications, parallel haplotype-specific copy number alterations and copy number segment length variation (serrate structural variations) had measurable phenotypic and evolutionary consequences. In TNBC and HGSC, clone-specific high-level amplifications in known oncogenes were highly prevalent in tumours bearing fold-back inversions, relative to tumours with homologous recombination deficiency, and were associated with increased clone-to-clone phenotypic variation. Parallel haplotype-specific alterations were also commonly observed, leading to~phylogenetic evolutionary diversity and clone-specific mono-allelic expression. Serrate variants were increased in tumours with fold-back inversions and were highly correlated with increased genomic diversity of cellular populations. Together, our findings show that cell-to-cell structural variation contributes to the origins of phenotypic and evolutionary diversity in TNBC and HGSC, and provide insight into the genomic and mutational~states of individual~cancer cells.},

Numbat exploits the evolutionary relationships between subclones to iteratively infer single-cell copy number profiles and tumor clonal phylogeny. Analysis of 22\,tumor samples, including multiple myeloma, gastric, breast and thyroid cancers, shows that Numbat can reconstruct the tumor copy number profile and precisely identify malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment. We identify genetic subpopulations with transcriptional signatures relevant to tumor progression and therapy resistance. Numbat requires neither sample-matched DNA data nor a priori genotyping, and is applicable to a wide range of experimental settings and cancer types.},

  abstract = {Cancer progression can be described by continuous-time Markov chains whose state space grows exponentially in the number of somatic mutations. The age of a tumor at diagnosis is typically unknown. Therefore, the quantity of interest is the time-marginal distribution over all possible genotypes of tumors, defined as the transient distribution integrated over an exponentially distributed observation time. It can be obtained as the solution of a large linear system. However, the sheer size of this system renders classical solvers infeasible. We consider Markov chains whose transition rates are separable functions, allowing for an efficient low-rank tensor representation of the linear system’s operator. Thus we can reduce the computational complexity from exponential to linear. We derive a convergent iterative method using low-rank formats whose result satisfies the normalization constraint of a distribution. We also perform numerical experiments illustrating that the marginal distribution is well approximated with low rank.},

Over the last decade, multiple bioinformatic tools have been developed to predict fusions from RNA-seq, based on either read mapping or de novo fusion transcript assembly.                                         Results               We benchmark 23 different methods including applications we develop, STAR-Fusion and TrinityFusion, leveraging both simulated and real RNA-seq. Overall, STAR-Fusion, Arriba, and STAR-SEQR are the most accurate and fastest for fusion detection on cancer transcriptomes.                                         Conclusion               The lower accuracy of de novo assembly-based methods notwithstanding, they are useful for reconstructing fusion isoforms and tumor viruses, both of which are important in cancer research.},

SCITE comprises a flexible Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme that allows the user to compute the maximum-likelihood mutation history, to sample from the posterior probability distribution, and to estimate the error rates of the underlying sequencing experiments. Evaluation on real cancer data and on simulation studies shows the scalability of SCITE to present-day single-cell sequencing data and improved reconstruction accuracy compared to existing approaches.},

Its application to cancer data has enhanced our understanding of mutational forces driving tumorigenesis and demonstrated its potential to inform prognosis and treatment decisions. However, methodological challenges remain for discovering new signatures and assigning proper weights to existing signatures, thereby hindering broader clinical applications. Here we present Mutational Signature Calculator (MuSiCal), a rigorous analytical framework with algorithms that solve major problems in the standard workflow. Our simulation studies demonstrate that MuSiCal outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for both signature discovery and assignment. By reanalyzing more than 2,700 cancer genomes, we provide an improved catalog of signatures and their assignments, discover nine indel signatures absent in the current catalog, resolve long-standing issues with the ambiguous ‘flat’ signatures and give insights into signatures with unknown etiologies. We expect MuSiCal and the improved catalog to be a step towards establishing best practices for mutational signature analysis.},

Analysis of three independent urothelial tumor cohorts demonstrates a strong association between somatic ERCC2 mutations and the activity of a mutational signature characterized by a broad spectrum of base changes. In addition, we note an association between the activity of this signature and smoking that is independent of ERCC2 mutation status, providing genomic evidence of tobacco-related mutagenesis in urothelial cancer. Together, these analyses identify an NER-related mutational signature and highlight the related roles of DNA damage and subsequent DNA repair in shaping tumor mutational landscape.},

These mutational signatures provide new insights into the causes of individual cancers, revealing both endogenous and exogenous factors that have influenced cancer development. This Review brings readers up to date in a field that is expanding in computational, experimental and clinical directions. We focus on recent conceptual advances, underscoring some of the caveats associated with using the mutational signature frameworks and highlighting the latest experimental insights.

Machine learning algorithms trained with deep mutational scanning (DMS) data have significant potential to improve this understanding and accelerate protein engineering campaigns. However, most machine learning (ML) approaches in this domain do not directly address effects of synonymous codons or positional epistasis on predicted expression levels. Here we used yeast surface display, deep mutational scanning, and nextgeneration DNA sequencing to quantify the expression fitness landscape of human myoglobin and train ML models to predict epistasis of double codon mutants. When fed with near comprehensive single mutant DMS data, our algorithm computed expression fitness values for double codon mutants using ML-predicted epistasis as an intermediate parameter. We next deployed this predictive model to screen {$>$} 3·106 unseen double codon mutants in silico and experimentally tested highly ranked candidate sequences, finding 14 of 16 with significantly enhanced expression levels. Our experimental DMS dataset combined with codon level epistasis-based ML constitutes an effective method for bootstrapping fitness predictions of high order mutational variants using experimental data from variants of lower order.},

A comprehensive picture of these genomic aberrations is therefore essential for the development of personalised and precise cancer diagnostics and therapies. Single-cell sequencing offers the highest resolution for copy number profiling down to the level of individual cells. Recent high-throughput protocols allow for the processing of hundreds of cells through shallow whole-genome DNA sequencing. The resulting low read-depth data poses substantial statistical and computational challenges to the identification of copy number alterations. We developed SCICoNE, a statistical model and MCMC algorithm tailored to single-cell copy number profiling from shallow whole-genome DNA sequencing data. SCICoNE reconstructs the history of copy number events in the tumour and uses these evolutionary relationships to identify the copy number profiles of the individual cells. We show the accuracy of this approach in evaluations on simulated data and demonstrate its practicability in applications to a xenograft breast cancer sample.},

The resulting intra-tumour heterogeneity plays an important role in cancer patient relapse and treatment failure, so that obtaining a clear understanding of each patient’s tumour composition and evolutionary history is key for personalized therapies. Single-cell sequencing (SCS) now provides the possibility to resolve tumour heterogeneity at the highest resolution of individual tumour cells, but brings with it challenges related to the particular noise profiles of the sequencing protocols as well as the complexity of the underlying evolutionary process.By modelling the noise processes and allowing mutations to be lost or to reoccur during tumour evolution, we present a method to jointly call mutations in each cell, reconstruct the phylogenetic relationship between cells, and determine the locations of mutational losses and recurrences. Our Bayesian approach allows us to accurately call mutations as well as to quantify our certainty in such predictions. We show the advantages of allowing mutational loss or recurrence with simulated data and present its application to tumour SCS data.SCIΦN is available at https://github.com/cbg-ethz/SCIPhIN.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Tumour progression is an evolutionary process in which different clones evolve over time, leading to intra-tumour heterogeneity. Interactions between clones can affect tumour evolution and hence disease progression and treatment outcome. Intra-tumoural pairs of mutations that are overrepresented in a co-occurring or clonally exclusive fashion over a cohort of patient samples may be suggestive of a synergistic effect between the different clones carrying these mutations. We therefore developed a novel statistical testing framework, called GeneAccord, to identify such gene pairs that are altered in distinct subclones of the same tumour. We analysed our framework for calibration and power. By comparing its performance to baseline methods, we demonstrate that to control type I errors, it is essential to account for the evolutionary dependencies among clones. In applying GeneAccord to the single-cell sequencing of a cohort of 123 acute myeloid leukaemia patients, we find 1 clonally co-occurring and 8 clonally exclusive gene pairs. The clonally exclusive pairs mostly involve genes of the key signalling pathways.},

  abstract = {Rejecting the null hypothesis in two-sample testing is a fundamental tool for scientific discovery. Yet, aside from concluding that two samples do not come from the same probability distribution, it is often of interest to characterize how the two distributions differ. Given samples from two densities f1 and f0, we consider the task of localizing occurrences of the inequality f1 {$>$} f0. To avoid the challenges associated with high-dimensional space, we propose a general hypothesis testing framework where hypotheses are formulated adaptively to the data by conditioning on the combined sample from the two densities. We then investigate a special case of this framework where the notion of locality is captured by a random walk on a weighted graph constructed over this combined sample. We derive a tractable testing procedure for this case employing a type of scan statistic, and provide non-asymptotic lower bounds on the power and accuracy of our test to detect whether f1 {$>$} f0 in a local sense. Furthermore, we characterize the test’s consistency according to a certain problem-hardness parameter, and show that our test achieves the minimax detection rate for this parameter. We conduct numerical experiments to validate our method, and demonstrate our approach on two real-world applications: detecting and localizing arsenic well contamination across the United States, and analyzing two-sample single-cell RNA sequencing data from melanoma patients.},

Here we develop methods to group, classify and describe somatic structural variants, using data from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which aggregated whole-genome sequencing data from 2,658~cancers across 38~tumour types8. Sixteen signatures of structural variation emerged. Deletions have a multimodal size distribution, assort unevenly across tumour types and patients, are enriched in late-replicating regions and correlate with inversions. Tandem duplications also have a multimodal size distribution, but are enriched in early-replicating regions-as are unbalanced translocations. Replication-based mechanisms of rearrangement generate varied chromosomal structures with low-level copy-number gains and frequent inverted rearrangements. One prominent structure consists of 2-7~templates copied from distinct regions of the genome strung together within one locus. Such cycles of templated insertions correlate with tandem duplications, and-in liver cancer-frequently activate the telomerase gene TERT. A wide variety of rearrangement processes are active in cancer, which generate complex configurations of the genome upon which selection can act.},

Although variant callers for bulk RNA-seq have been sporadically used in scRNA-seq, the performances of different tools have not been assessed. Results: Here, we perform a systematic comparison of seven tools including SAMtools, the GATK pipeline, CTAT, FreeBayes, MuTect2, Strelka2, and VarScan2, using both simulation and scRNA-seq datasets, and identify multiple elements influencing their performance. While the specificities are generally high, with sensitivities exceeding 90\% for most tools when calling homozygous SNVs in high-confident coding regions with sufficient read depths, such sensitivities dramatically decrease when calling SNVs with low read depths, low variant allele frequencies, or in specific genomic contexts. SAMtools shows the highest sensitivity in most cases especially with low supporting reads, despite the relatively low specificity in introns or high-identity regions. Strelka2 shows consistently good performance when sufficient supporting reads are provided, while FreeBayes shows good performance in the cases of high variant allele frequencies. Conclusions: We recommend SAMtools, Strelka2, FreeBayes, or CTAT, depending on the specific conditions of usage. Our study provides the first benchmarking to evaluate the performances of different SNV detection tools for scRNA-seq data.},

Multi-region and single-cell sequencing of tumors enable high-resolution reconstruction of the mutational history of each tumor and highlight the extensive diversity across tumors and patients. Resolving the interactions among mutations and recovering recurrent evolutionary processes may offer greater opportunities for successful therapeutic strategies. To this end, we present a novel probabilistic framework, called TreeMHN, for the joint inference of exclusivity patterns and recurrent trajectories from a cohort of intra-tumor phylogenetic trees. Through simulations, we show that TreeMHN outperforms existing alternatives that can only focus on one aspect of the task. By analyzing datasets of blood, lung, and breast cancers, we find the most likely evolutionary trajectories and mutational patterns, consistent with and enriching our current understanding of tumorigenesis. Moreover, TreeMHN facilitates the prediction of tumor evolution and provides probabilistic measures on the next mutational events given a tumor tree, a prerequisite for evolution-guided treatment strategies.},

  abstract = {Cancer progression is an evolutionary process shaped by both deterministic and stochastic forces. Multi-region and single-cell sequencing of tumors enable high-resolution reconstruction of the mutational history of each tumor and highlight the extensive diversity across tumors and patients. Resolving the interactions among mutations and recovering recurrent evolutionary processes may offer greater opportunities for successful therapeutic strategies. To this end, we present a novel probabilistic framework, called TreeMHN, for the joint inference of exclusivity patterns and recurrent trajectories from a cohort of intra-tumor phylogenetic trees. Through simulations, we show that TreeMHN outperforms existing alternatives that can only focus on one aspect of the task. By analyzing datasets of blood, lung, and breast cancers, we find the most likely evolutionary trajectories and mutational patterns, consistent with and enriching our current understanding of tumorigenesis. Moreover, TreeMHN facilitates the prediction of tumor evolution and provides probabilistic measures on the next mutational events given a tumor tree, a prerequisite for evolution-guided treatment strategies.},

  author = {Luo, Xiang Ge and Moffa, Giusi and Kuipers, Jack},
  abstract = {Bayesian networks are a powerful framework for studying the dependency structure of variables in a complex system. The problem of learning Bayesian networks is tightly associated with the given data type. Ordinal data, such as stages of cancer, rating scale survey questions, and letter grades for exams, are ubiquitous in applied research. However, existing solutions are mainly for continuous and nominal data. In this work, we propose an iterative score-and-search method - called the Ordinal Structural EM (OSEM) algorithm - for learning Bayesian networks from ordinal data. Unlike traditional approaches designed for nominal data, we explicitly respect the ordering amongst the categories. More precisely, we assume that the ordinal variables originate from marginally discretizing a set of Gaussian variables, whose structural dependence in the latent space follows a directed acyclic graph. Then, we adopt the Structural EM algorithm and derive closed-form scoring functions for efficient graph searching. Through simulation studies, we illustrate the superior performance of the OSEM algorithm compared to the alternatives and analyze various factors that may influence the learning accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our method with a real-world application on psychological survey data from 408 patients with co-morbid symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression.},

Using whole-genome sequencing of multiple myeloma (MM), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute myeloid leukemia, we compare the performance of public signature analysis tools. We describe caveats and pitfalls of de novo signature extraction and fitting approaches, reporting on common inaccuracies: erroneous signature assignment, identification of localized hyper-mutational processes, overcalling of signatures. We provide reproducible solutions to solve these issues and use orthogonal approaches to validate our results. We show how a comprehensive mutational signature analysis may provide relevant biological insights, reporting evidence of c-AID activity among unmutated CLL cases or the absence of BRCA1/BRCA2-mediated homologous recombination deficiency in a MM cohort.

To explore these mechanisms further, we generated catalogs of somatic mutation from 21 breast cancers and applied mathematical methods to extract mutational signatures of the underlying processes. Multiple distinct single- and double-nucleotide substitution signatures were discernible. Cancers with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations exhibited a characteristic combination of substitution mutation signatures and a distinctive profile of deletions. Complex relationships between somatic mutation prevalence and transcription were detected. A remarkable phenomenon of localized hypermutation, termed "kataegis," was observed. Regions of kataegis differed between cancers but usually colocalized with somatic rearrangements. Base substitutions in these regions were almost exclusively of cytosine at TpC dinucleotides. The mechanisms underlying most of these mutational signatures are unknown. However, a role for the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases is proposed.},

  abstract = {It is proposed that most neoplasms arise from a single cell of origin, and tumor progression results from acquired genetic variability within the original clone allowing sequential selection of more aggressive sublines. Tumor cell populations are apparently more genetically unstable than normal cells, perhaps from activation of specific gene loci in the neoplasm, continued presence of carcinogen, or even nutritional deficiencies within the tumor. The acquired genetic instability and associated selection process, most readily recognized cytogenetically, results in advanced human malignancies being highly individual karyotypically and biologically. Hence, each patient's cancer may require individual specific therapy, and even this may be thwarted by emergence of a genetically variant subline resistant to the treatment. More research should be directed toward understanding and controlling the evolutionary process in tumors before it reaches the late stage usually seen in clinical cancer.}

  abstract = {Mutational signatures refer to patterns in the occurrence of somatic mutations that might be uniquely ascribed to particular mutational process. Tumour mutation catalogues can reveal mutational signatures but are often consistent with the mutation spectra produced by a variety of mutagens. To date, after the analysis of tens of thousands of exomes and genomes from about 40 different cancer types, tens of mutational signatures characterized by a unique probability profile across the 96 trinucleotide-based mutation types have been identified, validated and catalogued. At the same time, several concurrent methods have been developed for either the quantification of the contribution of catalogued signatures in a given cancer sequence or the identification of new signatures from a sample of cancer sequences. A review of existing computational tools has been recently published to guide researchers and practitioners through their mutational signature analyses, but other tools have been introduced since its publication and, a systematic evaluation and comparison of the performance of such tools is still lacking. In order to fill this gap, we have carried out an empirical evaluation of the main packages available to date, using both real and simulated data. Among other results, our empirical study shows that the identification of signatures is more difficult for cancers characterized by multiple signatures each having a small contribution. This work suggests that detection methods based on probabilistic models, especially EMu and bayesNMF, have in general better performance than NMF-based methods.},

If Gaussian noise is added to a probability vector, we prove that the average sKL divergence converges to the KL divergence for small enough noise.

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Mutational signatures can be used to understand cancer origins and provide a unique opportunity to group tumor types that share the same origins and result from similar processes. These signatures have been identified from high throughput sequencing data generated from cancer genomes by using non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) techniques. Current methods based on optimization techniques are strongly sensitive to initial conditions due to high dimensionality and nonconvexity of the NMF paradigm. In this context, an important question consists in the determination of the actual number of signatures that best represent the data. The extraction of mutational signatures from high-throughput data still remains a daunting task. RESULTS: Here we present a new method for the statistical estimation of mutational signatures based on an empirical Bayesian treatment of the NMF model. While requiring minimal intervention from the user, our method addresses the determination of the number of signatures directly as a model selection problem. In addition, we introduce two new concepts of significant clinical relevance for evaluating the mutational profile. The advantages brought by our approach are shown by the analysis of real and synthetic data. The later is used to compare our approach against two alternative methods mostly used in the literature and with the same NMF parametrization as the one considered here. Our approach is robust to initial conditions and more accurate than competing alternatives. It also estimates the correct number of signatures even when other methods fail. Results on real data agree well with current knowledge.

Results: Application of deconstructSigs identifies samples with DNA repair deficiencies and reveals distinct and dynamic mutational processes molding the cancer genome in esophageal adenocarcinoma compared to squamous cell carcinomas.

Computing the probability distribution over states at time t requires the matrix exponential \$\$\textbackslash exp \textbackslash,\textbackslash left( tQ\textbackslash right) \textbackslash,\$\$, and inferring \$\$\textbackslash theta \$\$from data requires its derivative \$\$\textbackslash partial \textbackslash exp \textbackslash,\textbackslash left( tQ\textbackslash right) \textbackslash,/\textbackslash partial \textbackslash theta \$\$. Both are challenging to compute when the state space and hence the size of Q is huge. This can happen when the state space consists of all combinations of the values of several interacting discrete variables. Often it is even impossible to store Q. However, when Q can be written as a sum of tensor products, computing \$\$\textbackslash exp \textbackslash,\textbackslash left( tQ\textbackslash right) \textbackslash,\$\$becomes feasible by the uniformization method, which does not require explicit storage of Q. Here we provide an analogous algorithm for computing \$\$\textbackslash partial \textbackslash exp \textbackslash,\textbackslash left( tQ\textbackslash right) \textbackslash,/\textbackslash partial \textbackslash theta \$\$, the differentiated uniformization method. We demonstrate our algorithm for the stochastic SIR model of epidemic spread, for which we show that Q can be written as a sum of tensor products. We estimate monthly infection and recovery rates during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria and quantify their uncertainty in a full Bayesian analysis.

Genomic datasets of matched primary tumors and metastases may offer insights into the underpinnings and the dynamics of metastasis formation. We present metMHN, a cancer progression model designed to deduce the joint progression of primary tumors and metastases using cross-sectional cancer genomics data. The model elucidates the statistical dependencies among genomic events, the formation of metastasis, and the clinical emergence of both primary tumors and their metastatic counterparts. metMHN enables the chronological reconstruction of mutational sequences and facilitates estimation of the timing of metastatic seeding. In a study of nearly 5000 lung adenocarcinomas, metMHN pinpointed TP53 and EGFR as mediators of metastasis formation. Furthermore, the study revealed that post-seeding adaptation is predominantly influenced by frequent copy number alterations.

  abstract = {Cancers evolve by accumulating genetic alterations, such as mutations and copy number changes. The chronological order of these events is important for understanding the disease, but not directly observable from cross-sectional genomic data. Cancer progression models (CPMs), such as Mutual Hazard Networks (MHNs), reconstruct the progression dynamics of tumors by learning a network of causal interactions between genetic events from their co-occurrence patterns. However, current CPMs fail to include effects of genetic events on the observation of the tumor itself and assume that observation occurs independently of all genetic events. Since a dataset contains by definition only tumors at their moment of observation, neglecting any causal effects on this event leads to the “conditioning on a collider” bias: Events that make the tumor more likely to be observed appear anti-correlated, which results in spurious suppressive effects or masks promoting effects among genetic events. Here, we extend MHNs by modeling effects from genetic progression events on the observation event, thereby correcting for the collider bias. We derive an efficient tensor formula for the likelihood function and learn two models on somatic mutation datasets from the MSK-IMPACT study. In colon adenocarcinoma, we find a strong effect on observation by mutations in TP53, and in lung adenocarcinoma by mutations in EGFR. Compared to classical MHNs, this explains away many spurious suppressive interactions and uncovers several promoting effects. The data, code, and results are available at https://github.com/cbg-ethz/ObservationMHN.},

This leads to an observational gap, since the first data on the disease can only be obtained after diagnosis. Mutual Hazard Networks address this gap by reconstructing latent disease dynamics. They model the disease as a Markov chain on the space of all possible combinations of progression events. This space can be huge: Given a set of \$\$n\textbackslash ge 266\$\$events, its size exceeds the number of atoms in the universe. Mutual Hazard Networks combine time-to-event modeling with generalized probabilistic graphical models, regularization, and modern numerical tensor formats to enable efficient calculations in large state spaces using compressed data formats. Here we review Mutual Hazard Networks and put them in the context of machine learning theory. We describe how the Mutual Hazard assumption leads to a compact parameterization of the models and show how modern tensor formats allow for efficient computations in large state spaces. Finally, we show how Mutual Hazard Networks reconstruct the most likely history of glioblastomas.},

Here, we develop a new approach to mutation detection in individual tumor cells by leveraging the evolutionary relationship among cells. Our method, called SCIΦ, jointly calls mutations in individual cells and estimates the tumor phylogeny among these cells. Employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme enables us to reliably call mutations in each single cell even in experiments with high drop-out rates and missing data. We show that SCIΦ outperforms existing methods on simulated data and applied it to different real-world datasets, namely a whole exome breast cancer as well as a panel acute lymphoblastic leukemia dataset.},

Recent sequencing efforts have confirmed that USARCs exhibit one of the highest burdens of structural aberrations across human cancer. Here, we sought to unravel the molecular basis of the structural complexity in USARCs by integrating DNA sequencing, ploidy analysis, gene expression, and methylation profiling. We identified whole genome duplication as a prevalent and pernicious force in USARC tumorigenesis. Using mathematical deconvolution strategies to unravel the complex copy-number profiles and mutational timing models we infer distinct evolutionary pathways of these rare cancers. In addition, 15\% of tumors exhibited raised mutational burdens that correlated with gene expression signatures of immune infiltration, and good prognosis.},

  abstract = {Matrix factorization (MF) is a simple collaborative filtering technique that achieves superior recommendation accuracy by decomposing the user-item interaction matrix into user and item latent matrices. Because the model typically learns each interaction independently, it may overlook the underlying shared dependencies between users and items, resulting in less stable and interpretable recommendations. Based on these insights, we propose “Hierarchical Matrix Factorization” (HMF), which incorporates clustering concepts to capture the hierarchy, where leaf nodes and other nodes correspond to users/items and clusters, respectively. Central to our approach, called hierarchical embeddings, is the additional decomposition of the latent matrices (embeddings) into probabilistic connection matrices, which link the hierarchy, and a root cluster latent matrix. The embeddings are differentiable, allowing simultaneous learning of interactions and clustering using a single gradient descent method. Furthermore, the obtained cluster-specific interactions naturally summarize user-item interactions and provide interpretability. Experimental results on ratings and ranking predictions show that HMF outperforms existing MF methods, in particular achieving a 1.37 point improvement in RMSE for sparse interactions. Additionally, it was confirmed that the clustering integration of HMF has the potential for faster learning convergence and mitigation of overfitting compared to MF, and also provides interpretability through a cluster-centered case study.},

  abstract = {In large collections of tumor samples, it has been observed that sets of genes that are commonly involved in the same cancer pathways tend not to occur mutated together in the same patient. Such gene sets form mutually exclusive patterns of gene alterations in cancer genomic data. Computational approaches that detect mutually exclusive gene sets, rank and test candidate alteration patterns by rewarding the number of samples the pattern covers and by punishing its impurity, i.e., additional alterations that violate strict mutual exclusivity. However, the extant approaches do not account for possible observation errors. In practice, false negatives and especially false positives can severely bias evaluation and ranking of alteration patterns. To address these limitations, we develop a fully probabilistic, generative model of mutual exclusivity, explicitly taking coverage, impurity, as well as error rates into account, and devise efficient algorithms for parameter estimation and pattern ranking. Based on this model, we derive a statistical test of mutual exclusivity by comparing its likelihood to the null model that assumes independent gene alterations. Using extensive simulations, the new test is shown to be more powerful than a permutation test applied previously. When applied to detect mutual exclusivity patterns in glioblastoma and in pan-cancer data from twelve tumor types, we identify several significant patterns that are biologically relevant, most of which would not be detected by previous approaches. Our statistical modeling framework of mutual exclusivity provides increased flexibility and power to detect cancer pathways from genomic alteration data in the presence of noise.

We present a jumping hidden Markov model that describes the generation of viral quasispecies and a method to infer its parameters from next-generation sequencing data. The model introduces position-specific probability tables over the sequence alphabet to explain the diversity that can be found in the population at each site. Recombination events are indicated by a change of state, allowing a single observed read to originate from multiple sequences. We present a specific implementation of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to find maximum a posteriori estimates of the model parameters and a method to estimate the distribution of viral strains in the quasispecies. The model is validated on simulated data, showing the advantage of explicitly taking the recombination process into account, and applied to reads obtained from a clinical HIV sample.},

The analysis pins differential spectra of UV mutagenesis found in active and inactive chromatin to global genome nucleotide excision repair. TensorSignatures accurately characterises transcription-associated mutagenesis in 7 different cancer types. The algorithm also extracts distinct signatures of replication- and double strand break repair-driven mutagenesis by APOBEC3A and 3B with differential numbers and length of mutation clusters. Finally, TensorSignatures reproduces a signature of somatic hypermutation generating highly clustered variants at transcription start sites of active genes in lymphoid leukaemia, distinct from a general and less clustered signature of Polη-driven translesion synthesis found in a broad range of cancer types. In summary, TensorSignatures elucidates complex mutational footprints by characterising their underlying processes with respect to a multitude of genomic variables.},

However, practical tools for studying the signatures of copy number alterations are still lacking. Here, a user-friendly open source bioinformatics tool “sigminer” has been constructed for copy number signature extraction, analysis and visualization. This tool has been applied in prostate cancer (PC), which is particularly driven by complex genome alterations. Five copy number signatures are identified from human PC genome with this tool. The underlying mutational processes for each copy number signature have been illustrated. Sample clustering based on copy number signature exposure reveals considerable heterogeneity of PC, and copy number signatures show improved PC clinical outcome association when compared with SBS signatures. This copy number signature analysis in PC provides distinct insight into the etiology of PC, and potential biomarkers for PC stratification and prognosis.},

We identified 20 162 cancer driver mutations, 814 driver genes and 2360 pathogenic pathways with high-confidence by reanalyzing 10 769 exomes from 33 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 1942 genomes from 18 cancer types in International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). OncoVar provides four points of view, ‘Mutation’, ‘Gene’, ‘Pathway’ and ‘Cancer’, to help researchers to visualize the relationships between cancers and driver variants. Importantly, identification of actionable driver alterations provides promising druggable targets and repurposing opportunities of combinational therapies. OncoVar provides a user-friendly interface for browsing, searching and downloading somatic driver mutations, driver genes and pathogenic pathways in various cancer types.

  abstract = {Copy number aberrations (CNAs), which delete or amplify large contiguous segments of the genome, are a common type of somatic mutation in cancer. Copy number profiles, representing the number of copies of each region of a genome, are readily obtained from whole-genome sequencing or microarrays. However, modeling copy number evolution is a substantial challenge, because different CNAs may overlap with one another on the genome. A recent popular model for copy number evolution is the copy number distance (CND), defined as the length of a shortest sequence of deletions and amplifications of contiguous segments that transforms one profile into the other. In the CND, all events contribute equally; however, it is well known that rates of CNAs vary by length, genomic position and type (amplification versus deletion).We introduce a weighted CND that allows events to have varying weights, or probabilities, based on their length, position and type. We derive an efficient algorithm to compute the weighted CND as well as the associated transformation. This algorithm is based on the observation that the constraint matrix of the underlying optimization problem is totally unimodular. We show that the weighted CND improves phylogenetic reconstruction on simulated data where CNAs occur with varying probabilities, aids in the derivation of phylogenies from ultra-low-coverage single-cell DNA sequencing data and helps estimate CNA rates in a large pan-cancer dataset.Code is available at https://github.com/raphael-group/WCND.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {We present Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq data, MACS, which analyzes data generated by short read sequencers such as Solexa's Genome Analyzer. MACS empirically models the shift size of ChIP-Seq tags, and uses it to improve the spatial resolution of predicted binding sites. MACS also uses a dynamic Poisson distribution to effectively capture local biases in the genome, allowing for more robust predictions. MACS compares favorably to existing ChIP-Seq peak-finding algorithms, and is freely available.},

  abstract = {Single-cell DNA sequencing enables the construction of evolutionary trees that can reveal how tumors gain mutations and grow. Different whole genome amplification (WGA) procedures render genomic materials of different characteristics, often suitable for the detection of either single nucleotide variation (SNV) or for copy number aberration (CNA), but not for both, hindering the placement of both SNVs and CNAs on the same phylogenetic tree for the study of interplay of SNVs and CNAs. SCARLET places SNVs on a CNA tree, a tree derived based on the copy number profiles, while considering SNV loss due to copy number losses. However, SCARLET requires that the SNVs and CNAs are detected from the same sets of cells, which is technically challenging due to the sequencing errors or the low sequencing coverage associated with a particular WGA procedure. Here we presented a novel computational tool, SCsnvcna, that aims at placing SNVs on a CNA tree whereas the sets of cells rendering the SNVs and CNAs are independent, thus is more practical in terms of the technical challenge from single cell WGA process. SCsnvcna is a Bayesian probabilistic model that utilizes both the genotype constraints on the tree and the cellular prevalence (CP) to search the solution that has the highest joint probability. Both simulated and real datasets show that SCsnvcna is highly accurate in predicting the placement of SNVs and SNV cells. In addition, SCsnvcna has a precise prediction of SNV losses due to copy number loss.},

  abstract = {Significance             Comparative analysis of samples from two biological states, such as two stages of embryonic development, is a pressing problem in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). A key challenge is to detect cell subpopulations whose abundance differs between the two states. To that end, we develop DA-seq, a multiscale strategy to compare two cellular distributions. In contrast to existing unsupervised clustering-based analysis, DA-seq can delineate cell subpopulations with the most significant discrepancy between two states and potentially reveal important changes in cellular processes that are undetectable using conventional methods.           ,                             Comprehensive and accurate comparisons of transcriptomic distributions of cells from samples taken from two different biological states, such as healthy versus diseased individuals, are an emerging challenge in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. Current methods for detecting differentially abundant (DA) subpopulations between samples rely heavily on initial clustering of all cells in both samples. Often, this clustering step is inadequate since the DA subpopulations may not align with a clear cluster structure, and important differences between the two biological states can be missed. Here, we introduce DA-seq, a targeted approach for identifying DA subpopulations not restricted to clusters. DA-seq is a multiscale method that quantifies a local DA measure for each cell, which is computed from its               k               nearest neighboring cells across a range of               k               values. Based on this measure, DA-seq delineates contiguous significant DA subpopulations in the transcriptomic space. We apply DA-seq to several scRNA-seq datasets and highlight its improved ability to detect differences between distinct phenotypes in severe versus mildly ill COVID-19 patients, melanomas subjected to immune checkpoint therapy comparing responders to nonresponders, embryonic development at two time points, and young versus aging brain tissue. DA-seq enabled us to detect differences between these phenotypes. Importantly, we find that DA-seq not only recovers the DA cell types as discovered in the original studies but also reveals additional DA subpopulations that were not described before. Analysis of these subpopulations yields biological insights that would otherwise be undetected using conventional computational approaches.},
