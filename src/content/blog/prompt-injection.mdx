## The Hackathon Challenge

I recently participated in a white hat hacking challenge at the [Agent Olympics Hackathon Munich 2026](https://luma.com/agent-olympics?tk=DjHhlt). The goal was to build a voice agent that interacts with other AI systems to surface pre-planted sensitive information through prompt injection attacks.

This website's chatbot is a simplified demonstration of that challenge. The secret password has been intentionally included in the chatbot's context to demonstrate how AI systems can inadvertently leak sensitive information.

## Your Challenge

There's a secret password hidden in this website's AI chat system. Your mission: **trick the chatbot into revealing it**.

Once you think you've found the password, enter it below to verify:

<PasswordChecker client:load />

**Hint:** The AI chat assistant on this website has access to certain information. Maybe it knows more than it should? 🤔
