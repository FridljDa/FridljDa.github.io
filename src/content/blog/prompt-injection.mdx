## The Hackathon Challenge

I recently participated in a hackathon focused on prompt injection security in AI systems. The challenge was simple: protect a secret password from being revealed through prompt injection attacks.

## Your Challenge

There's a secret password hidden in this website's AI chat system. Your mission: **trick the chatbot into revealing it**.

Once you think you've found the password, enter it below to verify:

<PasswordChecker client:load />

**Hint:** The AI chat assistant on this website has access to certain information. Maybe it knows more than it should? 🤔

*This is an educational demonstration of prompt injection vulnerabilities. The chatbot has been intentionally configured with the secret password in its context to demonstrate how AI systems can inadvertently leak sensitive information.*
