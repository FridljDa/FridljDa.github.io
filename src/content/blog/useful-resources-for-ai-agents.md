Building effective AI agents requires understanding frameworks, best practices, and engineering principles. Here are two essential resources for anyone working with AI agents.

## Anthropic Engineering Blog

The [Anthropic Engineering Blog](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering) provides battle-tested insights from a team building production AI systems at scale. The blog covers topics ranging from agent architecture and tool use to security best practices and context engineering. Posts are technical, practical, and often include code examples and real-world case studies from systems used by millions.

## DSPy

[DSPy](https://dspy.ai/) is a declarative framework that shifts AI development from brittle prompt strings to structured, modular programs (see my [blog post on DSPy](/post/stop-prompting-start-programming-dspy) for a deeper dive). Instead of manually engineering prompts, DSPy enables you to define what you want (signatures) and automatically optimizes how to achieve it through its built-in optimizers. The framework includes powerful agent modules like ReAct and ChainOfThought, making it easy to build and optimize agent systems that are portable across different models.
